/*
 * STRATEGY:
 * This scriptable object acts as a state machine, and offers an architecture that relies on Dependency 
 * Injection and Observer pattern. 
 * 
 * COMMANDS AND REGISTERS
 * It receives state changes through the SetNewState method that offers the basics for the Command pattern.
 * It can be injected to scripts that require to follow state changes that may register/subscribe to OnStateTransition 
 * 
 * INITIALIZATION
 * As a bonus it also handles initialization, to make sure we can run some items in a given order at the
 * initialization of the game when the Awake and Start methods are not suited to grant a specific order
 *
 * SANITY CHECKS
 * This script keeps checking if the commands are legit, using unity built in assertions.
 *
 * SIDE NOTE
 * This script is using Odin Inspector for better visualization on the unity editor.
